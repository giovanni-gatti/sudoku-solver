# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

This Python project implements a Sudoku generator and solver using the Simulated Annealing algorithm. Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm based on stochastic processes and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) that is particularly effective in solving combinatorial optimization problems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giovanni-gatti/sudoku-solver.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sudoku-solver
    ```

3. (Optional, recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment: 

	```bash
	python -m venv venv 
	source venv/bin/activate
	```

4. Install the required dependencies (using pip):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
